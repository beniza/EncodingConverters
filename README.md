EncodingConverters
=================

Encoding conversion (TECkit) maps created for various Indic Langauges. You will need SIL Converter (http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=EncCnvtrs) to use them.
TECkit is a low-level toolkit intended to be used by other applications that need to perform encoding conversions (e.g., when importing legacy data into a Unicode-based application). The primary component of the TECkit package is therefore a library that performs conversions; this is the "TECkit engine". The engine relies on mapping tables in a specific binary format (for which documentation is available); there is a compiler that creates such tables from a human-readable mapping description (a simple text file).
