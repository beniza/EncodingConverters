# Ur-Nag Transliteration

Many socio-linguists consider Urdu and Hindi as textbook examples of `diagraphia` - a linguistic situation in which varities of same language written in different script. (R. Ahmed 2011)

Although both these languages share a lot of linguistic features, they differ in two important aspects, the Script and identity of the speakers. For the Muslim dominant Urdu speakers, Arabic (Script of the Holi Quran) based Nastaliq is the script of choice, wherein, the Hindu dominant Hindi speakers write Hindi in Devanagari (the script of Hindu scriptures).

Urdu is the national language of Pakistan. In India, though, majority of Indians consider Hindi as India's national language Gujarat High Court observed that "there was nothing on record to suggest that any provision has been made or order issued declaring Hindi as a national language of the country."
